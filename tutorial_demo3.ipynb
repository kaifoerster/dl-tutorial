This chain takes multiple input variables, uses the PromptTemplate to format them into a prompt. It then passes that to the model. Finally, it uses the OutputParser (if provided) to parse the output of the LLM into a final format.\n",
      "Chains is an incredibly generic concept which returns to a sequence of modular components (or other chains) combined in a particular way to accomplish a common use case.\n",
      "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an api, but will also: (1) Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data, (2) Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment. As such, the LangChain framework is designed with the objective in mind to enable those types of applications.\n",
