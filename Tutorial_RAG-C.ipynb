        "This comprehensive tutorial introduces Retrieval Augmented Generation with Citation (RAG-C) using Falcon 6B, a Large Language Model (LLM), and LangChain. It demonstrates how RAG-C enhances LLM responses by integrating external context, exemplified first through a practical case involving coffee prices in Berlin Mitte. Initially, the LLM is asked for coffee prices in Berlin Mitte without context, and then re-asked with specific context on coffee prices. The example illustrates the contrast between the LLM's hallucinated responses and context-informed answers. Participants will then engage in loading and embedding documents from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and programme the RAG-C, followed by its application in querying detailed FAR-related information. The tutorial culminates in a comparative quiz on FAR-specific questions between a pure LLM and the RAG-C enhanced model. Assessing the RAG-C against the pure LLM showcases the significant improvement in response accuracy and contextual relevance brought by RAG-C, thereby underlining its value in advancing LLM applications."

This concept is vividly demonstrated through a practical example: querying the LLM about coffee prices in a Berlin Mitte café. Initially, the LLM's response is based solely on its internal knowledge. However, when provided with actual price data as context, the tutorial showcases the remarkable improvement in the LLM's accuracy and relevance in its second attempt.\n",

        "This tutorial offers a focused exploration of Retrieval Augmented Generation with Citation (RAG-C), employing the Falcon 6B Large Language Model (LLM) and LangChain, to address the challenge of information accuracy in public policy-related inquiries. The primary goal is to demonstrate the significant enhancement in response quality when an LLM is augmented with specific contextual information. By initially presenting the LLM's base capability to generate responses without context – as seen in its attempt to provide coffee prices in Berlin Mitte – and then contrasting this with responses informed by specific contextual data, the tutorial highlights the issue of hallucination in LLMs and the importance of context for accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The practical application involves programming the RAG-C using documents from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a critical resource in public policy. This hands-on experience emphasizes how RAG-C can be tailored to deliver precise, contextually relevant information in policy-related fields. The tutorial culminates in a quiz focused on FAR, comparing the performance of the standard LLM against the RAG-C-enhanced model. This comparison not only showcases the effectiveness of RAG-C in reducing misinformation and enhancing accuracy but also serves as a learning outcome for users, demonstrating the practical implications of using augmented LLMs in public policy domains. \n",
        "\n",
        "A standout aspect of this tutorial is its commitment to open-source accessibility, ensuring that all models, codes, and methods demonstrated are available to everyone. Moreover, the tutorial is designed with computational efficiency in mind. Unlike the resource-heavy process of fine-tuning LLMs, the methods and applications showcased can be comfortably executed on standard laptops. This approach not only makes the tutorial more accessible but also practical for those with limited computational resources. \n",
        "\n",
        "A critical aspect covered in the tutorial is the potential for local server deployment, addressing the ever-important issue of data privacy. This theoretical adaptation allows for the hosting of both the LLM and the embedded database on local servers, presenting a practical solution for handling sensitive information, a common concern in policy-related applications. Additionally, the tutorial emphasizes the 'C' in RAG-C, which stands for Citation. This feature enhances the trustworthiness of the model's responses by citing the sources used in generating these responses. Such transparency is vital in public policy contexts, where the ability to verify and trust information is paramount.\n",

        "Retrieval Augmented Generation with Citation (RAG-C) is a sophisticated process that marries the expansive knowledge of a Large Language Model (LLM) with the precision of targeted information retrieval. To understand and engage with a tutorial on RAG-C, a user would typically need a foundational grasp of machine learning concepts, familiarity with natural language processing, and some experience with vector representations of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process starts with a user query that is transformed into a numerical representation known as a query vector. This transformation is accomplished through an embedding model, which digests the textual query and outputs a high-dimensional vector that captures its semantic essence. The magic lies in the embedding model's ability to encode the meaning of the text into a mathematical form that can be compared and matched against a vast repository of similarly encoded information.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the query vector in hand, the system then interacts with a vector database. This database is a curated collection of information that has been pre-processed and stored as vectors. The query vector serves as a key, unlocking a treasure trove of relevant contexts within this database—contexts that are semantically close to the intent and content of the initial query.\n",
        "\n",
        "The retrieved contexts, rich with information pertinent to the query, are then fed to the LLM along with the original query text. This hybrid input, augmented with specific, relevant information, enables the LLM to generate responses that are not only contextually rich but also grounded in the retrieved data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the 'C' in RAG-C brings an element of trust to the equation. As the LLM crafts its response, it also provides citations for the information it used from the vector database. This step is crucial, as it allows users to trace the origin of the information, ensuring the response's accuracy and allowing for independent verification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through a RAG-C tutorial, users would explore these steps, learning to implement each one and understanding how they come together to enhance the LLM's capabilities. The tutorial would likely cover the principles of vector space models, the mechanics of information retrieval, and the methodology of combining these with a pre-trained language model. The result is an intelligent system that not only answers with greater precision but also offers transparency in its responses."
