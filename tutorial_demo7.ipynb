A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract. The fixed fee does not vary with actual cost, but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. This contract type permits contracting for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but it provides the contractor only a minimum incentive to control costs. (b) Application. (1) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is suitable for use when the conditions of 16.301-2 are present and, for example- (i) The contract is for the performance of research or preliminary exploration or study, and the level of effort required is unknown; or (ii) The contract is for development and test, and using a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is not practical.

This contract type is commonly used for research, development, or initial design effort. It stands in contrast to a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. In a cost-indemnity contract, the contractor is not paid by the government for the convenience of receiving payment for incidental costs it results because of contract performance. Instead, the government pays the contractor for its cost in connection with the performance of the contract. The contractor serves as the agent of the government in administering the contract. It has no billing relationship with the government. Instead, it is the agent of the government and can bill the government for its costs as it sees fit. However, as with a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, it is preferable to use a cost-indemnity contract only for research, development, or initial design and not for ongoing efforts.\n",
