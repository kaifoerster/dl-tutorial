(1) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is suitable for use when the conditions of 16.301-2 are present and, for example- (i) The contract is for the performance of research or preliminary exploration or study, and the level of effort required is unknown; or (ii) The contract is for development and test, and using a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is not practical.
